To use the app follow 4 basic steps

1. Upon opening the app, go into the admin menu and set the current participant ID (i.e. CURB-1058). This will ensure that the data between different participants does not get mixed up. For a second measure of clarity, the text files will include the date and time that they were created. 

2. Hand the iPad to a participant and let them fill out the surveys. Note that, if you leave a page without submitting it, the entered data will not be saved.

3. Once the surveys are completed, (if the box next to its name is not green, the data was NOT saved) you can transfer the files stored locally on the iPad, in a folder called "CaTS Research" by plugging it into a computer, or by any other basic method you would use to transfer data from your phone to a computer.  

4. After transfering data, you can optionally, (but recommended), clear the stored data from the app through the admin menu.
