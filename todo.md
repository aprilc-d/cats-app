Here is a list of things I would have liked to do, but did not have time to do. 

1. missing scales:

    1. SCID-RV
        Note that its length will make it challenging

    2. CSSSR

    3. Hamiliton Depression

    4. TICS

    5. Demographics Survey

2. Keeping data cached if you leave a scale before submitting
    Probably can be done by using useState() and storing the values in the home screen. Then an array containing the information can be passed as an argument when a user navigates to that scale. 

3. I would have liked to deploy a stable android version of the app, and it is likely possible since React Native is cross platform and I didnt use any platform specific features, but that would likely require a long time messing with build settings in Android Studio.
